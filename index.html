                <p>
                    I grew up in a small town in central Arkansas. That's where most of my family
                    still lives, and always has lived for as long as, even my grandparents, know. I moved to Kansas
                    City,
                    Missouri
                    for my art degree when I graduated high school, and after saving up
                    some money, I moved to New York.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have a 50 pound goldendoodle named Nora and two cats named Florence and Olive.
                    They are my fur children, and they're also Arkansans.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I've been bartending ever since I moved to New York, and I've been
                    teaching myself how to code on the side as much as I have time. I hope to soon transition
                    to a career path that allows me to enhance what knowledge I have and will have.
